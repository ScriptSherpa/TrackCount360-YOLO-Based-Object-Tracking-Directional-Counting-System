# TrackCount360-YOLO-Based-Object-Tracking-Directional-Counting-System
TrackCount360 is an advanced object tracking and counting system built using UltralyticsYOLOv8 and  OpenCV. It not only detects and tracks objects in real-time video streams but also smartly  counts objects based on their direction of movement, such as upward or downward across custom-defined virtual lines.
